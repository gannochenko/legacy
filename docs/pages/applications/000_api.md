# API application

The microservice contains the following serverless functions:

* `runAPI` - provides API for data sourcing, mostly called during the build time of the front-end.
* `sendMessage` - allows sending a message via the contact form.

## SendinBlue

`SendinBlue` is used to send email. Either [reuse your previous API key](https://account.sendinblue.com/advanced/api/), or [create a new one](https://account.sendinblue.com/advanced/api/).

## CI/CD

Before running CI/CD make sure that the lambda functions mentioned above exists.
There is an infrastructure repository containing terraform files that, being applied, create all the resources.

### Secrets

So far we do not use any software like Vault for managing secrets.
The following secrets should be obtained/generated and then added as [environment variables on GitHub](https://github.com/gannochenko/legacy/settings/environments):

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* `AWS_REGION`
* `SENDIN_BLUE_API_KEY`

The other env vars come from the infrastructure.
